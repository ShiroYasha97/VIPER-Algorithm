**THIS PROJECT WAS MADE USING Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**

All the source code is located in the "VIPER Algorithm" folder
If you have Visual Studio, simply open the Solution file to view the code

HOW TO EXECUTE CODE

There is no need to compile the code.
Simply click on the VIPER Algorithm.exe shortcut to execute code
Once the GUI pops up follow these steps to run the algorithm

1. Load a proper DataBase file using the "Load" button located in the bottom left
There are a couple example files located under VIPER Algorithm/datasets

2. Enter a Minimum Support value in between 0 and 100 where it says "Minimum Support"

3. Hit "Run VIPER" to begin running the algorithm

4. After the algorithm has finished running, you may export all of 
the found Frequent Patterns by clicking the "Export Results" and giving the file a name

5. Repeat from step 1. if you wish to run the algorithm again
